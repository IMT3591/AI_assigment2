\section{Change management}
The bots have multiple ways of sensing the environment. An NPC will initially
receive the whole environment of static objects in the environment; houses,
structures and un-movable objects.  Based on this it plot its course and then
maintain an partially observable environment of a perimeter around itsself.

In this perimeter the NPC will be able to sense changes as they happen. Any
object entering the NPC's perimeter will bew added to its memory when they
are sensed through viewing.

Other live objects will be implemented into the environment as they are seen
and if they are touched without viewing them, i.e backing into a crate/wall or
being attacked).

Once they move out of the NPC's perimeter they will be removed from its memory
and then re-appear when they re-enter its perimeter.

\section{Methods of sensing}
The NPC's methods of sensing that an object appears in its path is through the
environment that depicts all static objects, and that the NPC receive a
specified environment from the server during gameplay about where it is and what
is in its personal perimiter.

Based on this the static objects will be avoided from the start, but dynamic
changes will be updated when they enter the NPC's perimiter.  Either through
touch or viewing.
