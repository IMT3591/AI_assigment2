\chapter{Task C}
This is the explanation of the different terms listed below, our results for
this is listed below in their respective sections.
\begin{description}
\item[Completeness:			]
	If there exists a goal state, will the agent find it during runtime?
\item[Optimality:				]
	Wheter the solution the agent finds is in fact the optimal path from A to B.
\item[Time Complexity:	]
	How long it will take for the agent to find the goal, if any.  We are
	measuring this in the following manner -- \textit{How many lines of codes is
	being executed during runtime}.  This is because it will yield a common value
	not influenced by CPU-time and inaccurate clock measurments.
\item[Memory Complexity:]
	How much memory is required by the program to find the solution. We measure
	this using Valgrind to compute how much memory is being used by the program.
