This is the explanation of the different terms listed below, our results for
this is listed below in their respective sections.
\begin{description}
\item[Completeness:			]
	If there exists a goal state, will the agent find it during runtime?
\item[Optimality:				]
	Wheter the solution the agent finds is in fact the optimal path from A to B.
\item[Time Complexity:	]
	How long it will take for the agent to find the goal, if any.  We are
	measuring this in the following manner -- \textit{How many lines of codes is
	being executed during runtime}.  This is because it will yield a common value
	not influenced by CPU-time and inaccurate clock measurments.
\item[Memory Complexity:]
	How much memory is required by the program to find the solution. We measure
	this using Valgrind to compute how much memory is being used by the program.
\end{description}

\section{A* Tree Search}
\begin{description}
\item[Completeness:			]	If there exist a goal state the algorithm will find it
	since it by continously expanding the currently cheapest path.
\item[Optimality:				]	It will find the optimal cost, since our heuristic,
	the shortest path, is never over estimated.
\item[Time Complexity:	]	Time complexity is measured using the unity LOC(Lines
	of Code) that is executed during runtime.
\item[Memory Complexity:]	Memory complexity is measured using valgdring
	measurement of total heap usage for the execution of the program.

\section{A* Graph Search}
\begin{description}
\item[Completeness:			]The algorithm finds the optimal path, but is not complete, It doesn't check all the expanded nodes.
\item[Optimality:				]It will find the optimal cost, since our heuristic,
	the shortest path, is never over estimated.
\item[Time Complexity:	]Time complexity is measured using the unity LOC(Lines
	of Code) that is executed during runtime.
\item[Memory Complexity:]	Memory complexity is measured using valgdring
	measurement of total heap usage for the execution of the program.
