		Our code is separated into two different programs. The main.cpp will run the
		tree search algorithm and the graphSearch.cpp will run the graph search
		algorithm.

		On windows the file path has to be altered to "../vertice.lst" instead of
		"vertice.lst" or similar according to where it is located in relation to
		where the executable is located.

		In visual studio import all files to the project and build and run either
		graphSearch.cpp or main.cpp to test the software.

		On linux run "make" to compile the tree search algorithm. Then execute 
		"./run.exe" to test the program.

		Use "make graph" to compile the graph search algorithm. Then also execute
		"./run.exe" to the the program.  
		
		To measure the memory allocation and so on run "valgrind ./run.exe" in
		terminal to run it, and on program exit it will display the memory usage.
